# Django-Demo-Webpage

This is my first Demo webpage I have made with Django. It is just one webpage and it doesn't have any Dynamic
features yet, but I aim to work on this to turn it into an actual Website. This contains just a webpage and also a
admin database.

To open this webpage, I will suggest using Pycharm as I have made this project using Pycharm only.

MAKE SURE YOU OPEN THIS PROJECT AS A DJANGO PROJECT, NOT AS A RAW PYTHON PROJECT.

Thank you for checking out this demo webpage.
